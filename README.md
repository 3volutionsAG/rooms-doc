# Docsy with "just docs"

This is an example customization of the [Docsy Example Project](https://github.com/google/docsy-example) that just has a docs section, rather than a full site.
It's hosted at https://docsyjustdocs.netlify.com/

You can learn more about Docsy and find detailed theme instructions in the Docsy user guide: https://docsy.dev/docs/
